# React frontend dependencies
#
# Note: React/Vite projects don't use Python `requirements.txt`.
# The actual dependency manifests are:
#   - `frontend/package.json` (declares dependencies)
#   - `frontend/package-lock.json` (pins exact versions)
#
# Install (recommended, uses package-lock):
#   npm ci
#
# Dev server:
#   npm run dev
#
# Production build:
#   npm run build
#
# Human-readable summary of key packages (source of truth is package.json):
